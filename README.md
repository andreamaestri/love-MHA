<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://andreamaestri.github.io/love-MHA/)

This website utilizes HTML and Bootstrap 5 to provide an accessible and responsive platform for mental health awareness.

Here's why:
* Bootstrap 5 offers amazing compatibility across devices and makes 'flex' elements easy to implement.
* HTML is great! :smile:
